# Tools for importing open data of Lithuania's legal entities 

Tools provided here allow you to download open data provided by the center of registers (Registr≈≥ centras) and Sodra, store that data in the MySQL database and perform further analyses. 

I used this tool to create a dataset that could be used for training ML models to calculate legal entity probability of bankruptcy. 

## Sources used:
* [Lithuania's center of registers](https://www.registrucentras.lt/p/1094)
* [Sodra](https://atvira.sodra.lt/imones/rinkiniai/index.html)

## Collect open data of the legal entities 
1. Run `docker-compose up`, this command spins up the local MySQL database, where all legal entities' data will be stored
2. Execute `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install libraries needed for importing the legal entities' data 
3. Run import by executing `python import_open_data.py`

### Database structure 
| Table name  | Description  |
|---|---|
| stg_legal_entities_addresses  | Addresses of legal entities registered in the center of registers  |
| stg_legal_entities_authorized_capital  | Authorized capital of registered legal entities |
| stg_legal_entities_balance_sheets  | Balance sheets provided by legal entities by finance year |
| stg_legal_entities_management  | Information on the management of registered legal entities  |
| stg_legal_entities_profit_loss_statements  | Profit loss statements provided by legal entities by finance year  |
| stg_registered_legal_entities  | Legal entities currently registered in the center of registers  |
| stg_unregistered_legal_entities  | Legal entities currently registered in center of registers |
| stg_sodra_monthly  | Monthly legal entities data provided for Sodra (average salaries, employees count, social security debt, etc.)  |

## Generate bankruptcy dataset
1. Perform steps listed [here](#how-to-collect-data)
2. Execute dataset generation by executing `python generate_bankruptcy_dataset.py`

Basic EDA of dataset could be find [here](bankruptcy_dataset.ipynb)

`null` - indicates that data was not provided in finance year balance sheets or profit/loss statements 

Statuses `Under Restructuring`, `Going Bankrupt`, `Bankrupt`, `Liquidation due to bankruptcy` were used as bankruptcy indicators. 

Two different bankruptcy labels are created:
1. `is_bankrupted_last_year` - when only the last financial years of the company being active are labeled as bankrupted 
2. `is_bankrupted_all_years` - when all companies' financial years (despite the company went bankrupt only during the last years) are marked as bankrupted

Sample of `is_bankrupted_last_year` and `is_bankrupted_all_years`
| code  | finance_year_start_date  | ...  | is_bankrupted_last_year  | is_bankrupted_all_years  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 11111  | 2018-01-01 | ... | 0 | 1 |
| 11111  | 2019-01-01 | ... | 0 | 1 |
| 11111  | 2020-01-01 | ... | 0 | 1 |
| 11111  | 2021-01-01 | ... | 1 | 1 |

### Bankruptcy data cleaning
For the preparation of the dataset some raw data were removed:
1. Removed rows where finance year start and financial year end were equal
2. Removed rows that did not had matching in balance and profit-loss tables when using registration code and finance year start date fields
